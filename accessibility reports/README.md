# Comments on the Accessibility Reports

To instructors,

We notice that many accessibility reports complain about contrast, ARIA, and list problems. However, since we used a react component library, [ant design](https://ant.design/), for better UI effect, those problems are intrinsic of antd components. Thus we are not able to change them. Please consider this case for our accessibility report.

Thank you!
